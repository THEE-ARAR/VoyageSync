## Overview
### Description
Allows users to tailor their journey based on their preference and interest for an unforgettable experience. Great for solo, group, and first time travelers. 
### App Evaluation 
- **Category:** Travel
- **Story:** Analyzes user preferences and creates a selection of activities, restaurants, and other excursions the user and/or group will enjoy. The users traveling in a group will be allowed to vote on which they would like to do and a budget will be created for each person to make planning the trip easier.  
- **Market:** Anyone over the [age limit] will be able to use this app as it allows for in-app purchases. In order to keep a safe enviorment, the creater/organizer of the trip will be given an access code to invite people on the trip. This access code will allow users to have access to that trip and only that trip outside of any they create on their own.
- **Habit:** This app can be used often or unoften depending on how long it takes to save money and plan for the trip. The itinerary created via the app can also be used during the trip to allow users to stick to a schedule.
- **Scope:** First, we will start by allowing users to pick their preferences in regards to traveling, then we will allow them the option to make it a group trip or keep it solo. From there, an itinerary will be created that the user can change as they see fit. In a group setting the itinerary will be voted on, anything less then the majority will be placed in a file for the designated person to have on their next itinerary if they visit there again. Based on the itinerary, a budget will be created for how much each person needs to save before purchasing the tickets, making a reservation, etc.. Potential to expand to booking hotels, flights, etc.
